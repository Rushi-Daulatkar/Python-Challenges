#Hello Coder
#Hope You Have Done With The Challenge 
#Here Is The Solution
# This Code Was Created In (PyCharm IDE)

first = input("Enter first Number :")               #variable declaration and input of First Number
opeartor = input("Enter operator (+,-,*,/,%) :")    #variable declaration and input of operation to be perform
second = input("Enter second Number :")             #variable declaration and input of second Number

first = int(first)                                  #type conversion
second = int(second)                                #type conversion

if operator == "+" :                                 #if loop
     print(first + second)

elif operator == "-" :                               #elif loop  
     print(first - second)

elif operator == "*" :                               #elif loop
     print(first * second)

elif operator == "/" :                               #elif loop
     print(first / second)

elif operator == "%" :                               #elif loop
     print(first % second)

else :                                               #else loop for any error that may occur
    print(INVALID OPERATION)
